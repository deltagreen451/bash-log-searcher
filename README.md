# bash-log-searcher
BASH script to search for specific lines in a text file in a server access log for a school assignment

Requirements
▪ Call the script searchlog.sh
▪ Prompt the user for:
  a) The pattern to be searched for
  b) Whether they want an whole word match or any match on the line
  c) If they want to do an inverted match, i.e. retrieve lines that do not contain the pattern
▪ If no match is found, report to the user “No matches found”.
▪ If a match is found, echo the number of matches found, e.g. 5 matches found, and then each of matching word(s)/line(s) to the terminal with their corresponding line numbers in the source file.
▪ In either case, ensure the user has the option to do another search if they so wish or exit the script.
▪ Ensure all search options are case-insensitive
